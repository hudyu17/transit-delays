## Overview
This repo features analysis of bus delays on the Toronto Transit Commission, containing `R` scripts and a final `PDF` report [(link here)](https://github.com/hudyu17/transit-delays/blob/main/outputs/paper.pdf). Data from 2014 to 2021 across the TTC's [bus](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-bus-delay-data/) network was examined, all sourced from Open Data Toronto. This analysis revealed that the type of incident and time of day of occurrence heavily influences delay duration, with night buses on the weekends seeing the worst effects. 

A datasheet was also prepared for the dataset that undergirded this analysis [(link here)](https://github.com/hudyu17/transit-delays/blob/main/outputs/Datasheet%20-%20TTC_Bus_Delays.pdf)
